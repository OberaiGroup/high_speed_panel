\section{Introduction}
% Outline:
% - Overview of hypersonic structures
%   - Emph: re-usability
% - What is high speed flow? Characteristics
% - When does and doesn't inertia matter?
% - When does large strain matter?
% - What is creep/ Norton creep?

High speed flow over a vehicle creates a harsh environment for 
the vehicle structure.
For example, the skin of the X-15 regularly saw temperatures
as high as 1220 $^{\circ}$F (933 K)
during its flights up to 6.7 Ma
\cite{ kordes_structureal_heating_experiencs_on_the_x15_airplane}.
A recent study by Culler et al. 
\cite{ culler_impact_of_FTS_coupling_on_response_prediction_hypersonic_skin_panels}
estimated temperatures exceeding 2500 $^\circ$F (1644 K) 
on the skin of a conceptual high speed vehicle.
These temperatures are greater than the solidus 
temperature of typical aluminum alloys used in aircraft design
\cite{ SAE_metals_and_alloys_in_the_unified_numbering_system}
and within the range where creep has been observed for 
high temperature titanium alloys 
\cite{
  evans_effects_of_alpha_case_formation_on_creep_fracture_properties_of_the_high_temperature_titanium_alloy_IMI834,
  lavina_creep_behavior_of_Ti6Al4V_from_450C_to_600C}.

The skin of a high speed vehicle must support both
the aerodynamic tractions and heating during flight.
Recent interest in reusable vehicles requires
the skin to endure multiple cycles of this loading

  lafontaine_effects_of_strain_hardeing_on_response_of_skin_panels_in_hypersonic_flow}.
The skin panels are typically designed as thin face plates supported 
by stiffeners 
\cite{
  mcnamara_aeroelastic_and_aerothermoelastic_analysis_in_hypersonic_flow_past_present_and_future}.
The face plate and stiffeners of the panel 
can be made of materials on the order
of hundredth of inch thick
\cite{
  plews_a_two_scale_generalized_finite_element_approach_for_modeling_localized_thermoplasticity,
  zuchowski_AVIATR_Predictive_capability_for_hypersonic_structural_response_and_life_prediction_phase_II}.
The panels are compliant and can exhibit combinations of
inertia dominate flapping or thermally dominate buckling
\cite{
  thornton_coupled_flow_thermal_and_structural_analysis_of_aerodynamically_heated_panels,
  mei_review_of_nonlinear_panel_flutter_at_supersonic_and_hypersonic_speeds}.
Much work has been done to investigate the fluttering 
of panels in high speed flow

A study by LaFontaine et al.
\cite{
  lafontaine_effects_of_strain_hardeing_on_response_of_skin_panels_in_hypersonic_flow}
investigated the effects of accumulated 
plastic strain and permanent set of a panel in high speed flow.
The panel material in this study was modeled with an additive 
strain decomposition, a Chaboche kinematic hardening model,
and a $J_2$ flow rule. 
The panel interaction with the flow was modeled through
Eckert's reference enthalpy method 
\cite{
  eckert_engineering_relations_for_heat_transfer_and_friction_in_high_velocity_laminar_and_turbulent_flow}
and \nth{3} order piston theory
\cite{
meijer_generalized_formulation_and_review_of_piston_theory_for_airfoils}.
It was found that by including plasticity, 
the behavior of the panel changed after four loading cycles 
as compared to an otherwise equivalent linearly elastic panel;
each cycle represented one ten second flight.

This study investigates the role creep and plasticity play 
in the permanent deformation of a panel under repeated high speed flight.
The amount of deformation of a body undergoes due to creep increases 
with both time and temperature
\cite{roylance_mechanics_of_materials_text}. 
Plasticity through a von Mises yield surface is also modeled;
a multiplicatively decomposed version is used to allow for 
possible large strains.
The details of the model and implementation used are
discussed in 
\cite{ li_simulation_of_finite_strain_inelastic_phenomena_governed_by_creep_and_plasticity}.

Note to the reviewers: A more extensive review of the 
state of the art will be included in the 
final manuscript.

\section{Methods} \label{sec_methods}
% outline:
%  - Panel geometry used
%  - Explain Creep + Plasticity from Zhen's model
%  - Loading: Repeated historical temperature
%  - Compare results to literature

The goal of this study is to model the large creep deformation of a canonical acreage
panel due to the thermal loads experienced from repeated high speed flight.
As an approximation of the expected creep strain,
a bar that is fixed on both ends is considered as it 
undergoes a relevant temperature history.
This bar represents one strip of skin paneling from 
a high speed vehicle.

The bar starts at temperature $\theta_0$ at a stress free state. 
A uniform temperature $\theta(t)$ is prescribed everywhere.
The total strain is:

\begin{equation}
\epsilon^T = \epsilon^e + \epsilon^c
\end{equation}

\noindent
with $\epsilon^T$ as the total strain,
$\epsilon^e$ as the elastic strain,
and
$\epsilon^c$ as the creep strain.
The total deflection (and strain) of the bar must be zero as it 
is fixed on both ends:

\begin{align}
\epsilon^T &= \epsilon^e + \epsilon^c = 0 \\
\Rightarrow
  \epsilon^e &= -\epsilon^c 
\end{align}

The stress from temperature change is approximated by:

\begin{equation}
\sigma = E \left( \epsilon^e + \alpha (\theta(t) - \theta_0) \right)
\end{equation}

\noindent
with $\sigma$ as the Cauchy stress, 
$\alpha$ as the Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE),
and 
$E$ as Young's modulus of the material.
Substituting for the strain relation gives:

\begin{equation}
\sigma = E \left( \alpha (\theta(t) - \theta_0) - \epsilon^c) \right) 
\end{equation}

Next, it is assumed that there is no volume change over time.
This is consistent with the fixed boundary condition at 
each end of the bar.
This allows the Kirchoff stress to be equivalent to the Cauchy stress:

\begin{align}
\tau &= J \sigma \\
\Rightarrow
  \tau &= \sigma
\end{align}

\noindent
where $\tau$ is the Kirchoff stress,
$J=\det(F)$,
and $F$ is the deformation gradient.
The creep strain rate, as outlined in 
\cite{ li_simulation_of_finite_strain_inelastic_phenomena_governed_by_creep_and_plasticity},
is:

\begin{equation}
\dot{\epsilon^c} = \bar{A} e^{\frac{-Q}{R \theta}} \left( \frac{\tau}{\sigma_0} \right)^{c_1}
\end{equation}

\noindent
with $\bar{A}$ as the relaxation rate,
$Q$ as the activation energy,
$R$ is the universal gas constant,
$\sigma_0$ is a reference stress,
and
$c_1$ is the stress exponent.
Plugging in for the Kirchoff stress:

\begin{equation} \label{eq_creep_ode}
\dot{\epsilon^c} = \bar{A} e^{\frac{-Q}{R \theta(t)}} 
    \left( \frac{E ( \alpha (\theta(t) - \theta_0) - \epsilon^c)}{\sigma_0} \right)^{c_1}
\end{equation}

This is the ODE of the creep strain driven by the temperature change.
Material properties for titanium alloy Ti6Al4V were then estimated from
Lavina et al. \cite{ lavina_creep_behavior_of_Ti6Al4V_from_450C_to_600C}
for creep parameters and from \cite{
boyer_materials_properties_handbook_titanium_alloys}
for the Young's modulus and the CTE of the material.
For this unit set the universal gas constant is 8.3145 J/(Mol$\cdot$K)
and the relaxation parameter, $\bar{A}$, was taken as 1 with units of per second.
The material parameters used are shown in Table \ref{tab_material_properties}.

  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    Variable & Value & Units  \\
    \hline
    $\sigma_0$ & 18.7  & MPa    \\

    $\alpha$ & 9.7E-6  & 1/K    \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \label{tab_material_properties}
\end{table}


The initial and prescribed temperatures are borrowed from 
\cite{ culler_impact_of_FTS_coupling_on_response_prediction_hypersonic_skin_panels}.
In this study, the transient thermo mechanical response of a panel from the 
surface of a representative concept vehicle is simulated with a coupled framework.
The initial temperature is 70 $^{\circ}$F and a steady state temperature 
of 2750 $^{\circ}$F is achieved after the first 25 seconds of flight.
Note that the vehicle is assumed to start at its cruising speed of 12 Ma.
Incorporating into the bar problem (after converting to Kelvin) 
gives $\theta_0 = 294 K$ and:

\begin{equation}
\theta(t) = \begin{cases}
 \theta_0 + (59.65 \text{K/s})t & t < t_{ss} \\
1783 K                          & t\geq t_{ss}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\noindent
with $t_{ss}$ as the steady state time of 25 seconds.
This equates to a linear increase in temperature from 
$\theta_0$ at zero seconds to 1783 K at $t_{ss}$.
This temperature is then held constant.
For reference, a measure of the ``activation temperature'' 
$\left(\frac{Q}{R}\right)$ is 3019 K.

The ODE in Eq \ref{eq_creep_ode} was solved over a time period to represent a
vehicle's total flight time.
Based on the X-15, flights with an average of 10 minutes each 
\cite{ kordes_structureal_heating_experiencs_on_the_x15_airplane}
were considered.
Only one flight was considered giving a total time of 600 seconds.
The creep strain during this single flight is shown in Figure
\ref{fig_creep_strain}.
A focused view on the first 50 seconds of flight is shown 
in Figure \ref{fig_focused_creep_strain}.
Note the estimated thermal strain is 1.4\%.

  \caption{ Creep strain over time.}
  \label{fig_focused_creep_strain}
\end{figure}

As shown in Figures \ref{fig_creep_strain}
and \ref{fig_focused_creep_strain}, the creep strain in the bar 
grows to match that from the thermal strain. 
The creep strain reaches an approximate steady state 
at 25 seconds into the flight. 
This matches the time when the temperature also reaches
its steady state value.
The value of the creep strain does not start noticeable increasing
until approximately 7 seconds into the flight.
This corresponds to a temperature of 714 K.
